# Air-Quality

## Description of Project
As part of my independent capstone study in computational research and data analysis this year, I created a heat map of benzene concentrations in the air in certain Manhattan zip code locations. The air quality project in particular allowed me to explore the geopandas, folium, pandas, and numpy libraries. The most difficult part of the project was combining different datatypes in order to produce the heatmap. The folium library, which I used to create the heat map, required two-dimensional data points: a set of a latitude and longitude value.
